# PDC Workflow

PDC-Capture -> PDC-Quality -> PDC-Store

PDC-AccessControl should be provided for the users to Capture Cheque.

Cheque stays in PDC-Store until the date is current and then it automatically moves to PS-ECC.

PDC reports can be used to see the status of the cheque.

## PDC Query Status (PDC Lodging Service)

### Fix for the above issue
```
change the IP for the following files

/u01/tomcat/webapps/PDC/WEB-INF/tags/IntConfiguration.tag

/u01/tomcatint/webapps/PDCINT/WEB-INF/IncludedFiles/TagDirectives.jsp

```

### Manually send failed batches to next stage 

Tools -> Integration Failed Batches (Select PDC from status category and export)
