# ECC FLOW

CEN_HOME
    QCBServices 
    ECCNServices
ECC_HOME
	ECCServices    

Wnenever there is a connection problem between banks first thing we can do is check for ping logs or Listener Logs. example in case of ECC_HOME we check ECCBankPing_4.log(for ping) and DBMListener_4.log in the path /u01/ECC_HOME/ECCServices/Logs/4.

If we see that the ping is not working then we check if the status of the connection services whether it is working or stopped.

We can start the service if its not working and check in the apps if everything works fine.
```
example:- sh /etc/init.d/QIBECCServices start (starts the QIB Service)
